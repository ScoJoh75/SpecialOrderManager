# SpecialOrderManager
Python/Django application for entering special order and contacting end users who need to be aware of the order.

This Special Order Manager was created to allow an end user to enter and track special orders moving through a production facility.

Upon entering a new order emails are sent to different contacts to inform them of the upcoming special order.
